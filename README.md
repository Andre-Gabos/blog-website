# blog-website
This project was developed to study the interaction between front-end and back-end, and as a learning medium for using Node.js and EJS. Bootstrap was used to quickly create a design and MongoDB was used to store all the blog posts.

As a representation for a personal blog, this app has a Contact page and About page to hold the owner's information, along with the Home page where all the blog posts go. All the posts in the Home page are cut to a preview and have their own page that can be accessed through their respectives "read more" links. New posts can be written in a hidden page, that can be accessed by adding "/compose" to the home URL.
